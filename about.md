Bifrostech is building the CryptoBadge platform that bridges the digital and physical worlds by using physical badges that contain non-clonable, unique, machine readable patterns. The identity of these tags, and the object that they are associated with, are stored in a decentralized, and immutable record using the blockchain technology that provides the user with the ability to observe the chain of custody. This chain of custody will allow you to be able to rapidly and easily differntiate between authentic and counterfeit products. Furthermore, you will be able to determine whether the seller actually owns the object. This technology has the potential to reduce counterfeiting and surface nefarious sellers.

## CryptoBadges

Before CryptoBadge, consumers had no way to authenticate the manufacturer or ownership of physical items such as televisions, handbags, sports memorabilia, or even clothing. Furthermore, a seller had no way of proving ownership of the object and therefore exchanges relied on trust and reputation. Today, [Bifrostech](https://www.bifrostech) is working to change that. You can attach a CryptoBadge to almost any object and within minutes, using the [Bifrostech](https://www.bifrostech) platform, you can register yourself as the owner and/or manufacturer of the object. When you are ready to sell the item you can easily transfer ownership using the Bifrostech platform. All of these ownership transactions are stored in an immutable record that allows anyone to observe the chain of custody.
