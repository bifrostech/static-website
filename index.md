# Bifrostech introduces Non-Fungable Physical Tokens (NFpT)

Have you ever bought an used item and wondered “is this a stolen item?” 

Have you ever purchased an item from an on-line retailer and wondered “is this authentic or a knockoff?” 

Are you a manufacturer and concerned about counterfeit products diluting your brand or increasing your liability? 

Are you an art or memorabilia collector who is concerned about the authenticity?  

**Bifrostech** is excited to introduce a new patented technology that bridges the physical and the blockchain world ([Bifrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st){:target="_blank"}) that will revolutionize how physical products are authenticated, bought, sold and traded.
